# Build
Requires GCC.
- `make game` builds `springer.exe`.
- `make tests` builds `springer_tests.exe`
- `make clean` removes the `obj` directory and built executables.

# Development
Currently, castling and en passant are complete. Checkmate, stalemate, draw by fifty-move rule, and draw by insufficient material are complete. Search are yet to be implemented.
